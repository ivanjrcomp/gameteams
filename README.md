## **Summary**

This simple React Native project, empowers users to create groups and form teams for any type of game. With cross-device functionality, it seamlessly adapts to different platforms, providing a convenient and enjoyable gaming experience. 

## **Solution**

As mentioned before, this project was developed using React Native with Expo (Managed Workflow) as the framework, running on Expo Go. However, unlike my previous projects, I had the opportunity to explore additional features such as Styled Components, Async Storage, Routing and navigation, custom themes, integration of the Phosphor Icon package, custom fonts and the Module Resolver package for Babel.

Similar to my other projects, the main focus here is not on complex solutions but on learning new concepts and practices.

Lastly, I want to emphasize that the practices and knowledge gained throughout this project, which I am sharing here, are applicable to a wide range of solutions. My hope is to assist those who are interested in utilizing these concepts.

## **Requirements**

- Node.JS: 18.14.0
    - NPM Package: 9.6.6

## **Quickstart**

Below are the step-by-step instructions for running the project in your emulator or phone:

1. Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device and ensure that it is connected to the same wireless network as your computer. For Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal and open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner in the default Camera app. Alternatively, you can also run the project on an emulator. 
2. After installing Expo Go on the emulator or your device, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:<br />
    + `npm install`
3. Finally, start the Expo development server to run the application using the following command. If you are using a mobile device, scan the QR code that appears:
    + `npx expo start`

> **Warning** <br />
*It is common for VSCode, if it is your IDE, to not recognize certain code snippets and display adjustment warnings. However, simply reopening the project in VSCode after installing the dependencies will prevent these alerts from being displayed.
